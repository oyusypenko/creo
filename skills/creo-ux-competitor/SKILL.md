# Competitor UX Analysis

Analyze external competitor websites to extract UX insights and learnings. Navigates competitor sites as a real user, documents their UX patterns, evaluates against professional standards, and identifies opportunities for differentiation.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/creo ux-competitor <url>` | Analyze a single competitor website |
| `/creo ux-competitor compare <url1> <url2>` | Compare two competitor websites |

## Core Instructions

### Configuration

1. Check for project-specific config at `.claude/project-config.md`
2. Read `competitors` (pre-configured list by tier), `reports_path`
3. If no config exists, ask user for competitor URL

### Phase 1: Competitor Research

Before navigating, gather background info via web search:
- Company background and target audience
- Key features and value proposition
- User reviews (what people love and hate)

Identify key flows to analyze:
- Onboarding / Sign-up
- Core feature experience
- Pricing / Conversion
- Mobile experience

### Phase 2: Live Analysis

Navigation strategy:
1. Start at homepage
2. Follow the primary user journey
3. Screenshot every meaningful screen (use full page capture)
4. Note micro-interactions and feedback
5. Test on multiple viewports (375px mobile, 1440px desktop)

What to capture:
- First impressions (homepage)
- Sign-up / Onboarding flow
- Core feature experience
- Empty states and error handling
- Help / Support access
- Pricing presentation

### Phase 3: Professional Evaluation

#### JTBD Analysis

| 3 | User control | Can users undo/cancel? |
| 4 | Consistency | Are patterns repeated? |
| 5 | Error prevention | Are mistakes prevented? |
| 6 | Recognition | Are options visible? |
| 7 | Flexibility | Are there shortcuts? |
| 8 | Minimalism | Is it clutter-free? |
| 9 | Error recovery | Are error messages helpful? |
| 10 | Help | Is guidance available? |
