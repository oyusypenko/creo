Write prompts in a universal style that works across different models.

### Visual Style Guide

- People: Diverse professionals, authentic expressions, engaged in work
- Tech: Modern devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones)
- Colors: Clean whites, soft blues, professional neutrals

#### Do Include
- Real work scenarios (editing, reviewing, collaborating)
- Professional equipment when relevant
- Screen interfaces showing relevant content (blurred for realism)
- Natural, candid moments (not staged stock photo poses)
- Modern, minimalist workspaces

#### Do Not Include
- Text overlays or watermarks (except ogImage which may have text space)

- Overly dramatic lighting
- Artificial or staged poses

### Image Types and Dimensions

| Type | Purpose | Aspect Ratio | Prompt Focus |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| `hero` | Main page header | 16:9 landscape | Wide scene, establishing shot |
| `card` | Feature/listing cards | 4:3 or 1:1 | Focused detail, single concept |
| `thumbnail` | Small previews | 1:1 square | Simple, recognizable |
| `ogImage` | Social sharing | 1200x630 | Include "text space for [title]" |
| `heroMobile` | Mobile hero | 9:16 portrait | Vertical composition |

### Prompt Structure

Each prompt should follow:
```
[Setting/Environment]. [Main subject and action]. [Key objects/props relevant to topic]. [Lighting and atmosphere]. [Style notes: documentary-style, authentic, professional].
```

### Category-Specific Guidelines

#### Features
- Focus on the feature in action
- Show the benefit/outcome, not just the tool
- Include relevant equipment

#### Use Cases
- Show the target user in their natural work environment
- Include profession-specific props
- Capture the workflow improvement

#### Sources/Integrations
- Show the platform being used
- Screen should show recognizable interface (blurred/generic)
- Focus on the integration workflow

### Input Sources

Read page content from:
- Locale/i18n files (e.g., `messages/en/pages/`)
- Content configuration files
- Markdown content files

### Output Format

Generate prompts as a JavaScript object:

```javascript
const CONTEXT_AWARE_PROMPTS = {
  landing: {
    hero: `[prompt]`,
    ogImage: `[prompt]`,
    heroMobile: `[prompt]`,
  },
  features: {
    featureName: {
      hero: `[prompt]`,
      card: `[prompt]`,
      thumbnail: `[prompt]`,
      ogImage: `[prompt]`,
    },
  },
};
```

### Model-Specific Tips

For photorealistic results add: `photorealistic, 8k, high detail, professional photography`

For illustration style add: `digital illustration, vector art, flat design, modern graphic style`

For cinematic feel add: `cinematic lighting, film grain, shallow depth of field, 35mm`

### Workflow

1. Read the content for the page (locale files, content config)
2. Extract key context: page title, value proposition, features, target audience
3. Generate prompts for each image type
4. Validate prompts follow style guide
5. Output in the required format
